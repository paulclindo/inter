# Web Developer Test - InterConnecta

## About
At InterConnecta we work on a daily basis with CRMs. These are platforms with databases that store people, company, and transactional information.

These platforms, like many other applications we use, have an API that can be used to extract their data. That is your objective today!

## The Test

### Objective
Create a simple web interface that obtains all Lead records from Zoho CRM via their API and then presents them to the user on a table.

### Requirements
- Button to obtain records
- The table must contain the followin columns:
    + First Name
    + Last Name
    + Email
- Publish to a personal GitHub account

### Environment
- We recommend using JavaScript and PHP but feel free to work as you need.
- Bonus points for using a JS framework such as Vue.js, React, or Angular.
